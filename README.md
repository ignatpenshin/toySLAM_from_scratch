# toySLAM_from_scratch
Playing with freq, parameters of FAST/BRIEF, graph-based ideas

Just try to see all new ideas and knowledge to understand stpes of George Hotz programming his SLAM on TWITCH. Step by step.
Than try to understand, what OpenVSLAM project contented with. Than try to make some changes or just try to be more kind with this new knowledge.
Now the easiest part (George Hotz | Programming | Livecoding SLAM | twitchslam | Part 1), 
from where I can learn some ideas to my own project or just try to build knowledge-base I need. Hope I'll be hard-working with all this new stuff. Good luck to me ^_^:
