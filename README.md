# toySLAM_from_scratch
Playing with freq, parameters of FAST/BRIEF, graph-based ideas

Just try to see all new ideas and knowledge to understand stpes of George Hotz programming his SLAM on TWITCH. Step by step.
Than try to understand, what OpenVSLAM project contented with. Than try to make some changes or just try to be more kind with this new knowledge.

*** Maybe I need to understand the basics of my own product dev: 
(where I should to add yaml, protobuff, Docker (so wtf is that) and WebSocket SocketViewer - actually this is the idea of streamig data to the Server:
so I need to understand microservices idea. And how to work with C++/g++/cmake and stuff and wtf is dependencies between the different modules.
And how to works with logged maps or tracks / how to save and read maps and bring to life repeatable localizations. 
Than I need to understand to put in one bag all academical knowledge about theory and found best correlation with avaliable or easy-dev scripts.)*** 

Now the easiest part (George Hotz | Programming | Livecoding SLAM | twitchslam | Part 1), 
from where I can learn some ideas to my own project or just try to build knowledge-base I need. I hope be hard-working with all this new stuff. Good luck to me ^_^:
